- **User Interface:** The visual elements include the address bar, home button, next button, and all other elements that fetch and display the web page requested by the end-user.

- **Browser Engine:** The performance and features of a browser engine can greatly impact the user experience of a web browser. A fast and efficient browser engine can help web pages load quickly and smoothly, while a slower or less capable engine may struggle to render complex pages or provide a smooth browsing experience.

- **Rendering Engine:** It interprets HTML and XML documents along with images that are styled or formatted using CSS, and a final layout is generated, which is displayed on the user interface.

- **Network:** This component is responsible for managing network calls using standard protocols like HTTP or FTP.

- **JavaScript Interpreter:** As the name suggests, it is responsible for parsing and executing the JavaScript code embedded in a website.

- **UI Backend:** It is mainly used for drawing basic widgets (windows and combo boxes).
